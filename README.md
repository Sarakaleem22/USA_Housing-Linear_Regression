# USA_Housing-Linear_Regression

## Project Overview
* Implemented Linear Regression model too predict the price of the houses in USA.
* Checked missing values and also checked the correlation between the variables in the dataset.
* Split the dataset into training - testing as 0.8:0.2
* Used R^2 as the performance measure of the model.
* Predicted the price of the house based on user input.

## Codes and Resources
* Google Colab
* Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seasborn

## Model Implementation and Performance
First, I did research and decided the model that I will be implementing for this project. Then, I studied the dataset. I used 0.8:0.2 train-test split.

* The R^2 score for the model was 0.9269290796301859

## Conclusion
Overall it was a simple and beginner level implementation of machine learning model. The model performed well with 92.69% score.
